1. What is ScubaKit?
	
	ScubaKit is a plugin for Bukkit (itself a mod for Minecraft) that allows helmets to be used as scuba diving dear.
	Basicly, having a helmet increases your maximum air, the time can be configured.

2. How do I install ScubaKit?

	Simply place the ScubaKit.jar file into your Plugin directory. 
	If you got a jar file that reads something like ScubaKit-1.0.0.jar, you need to remove the "-1.0.0" part from it.
	I think, I never actually tested leaving it there. There is an included folder that contains the config.yml, but you don't HAVE to put that in. The plugin will create that automaticly

3. How do I configure ScubaKit?

	open config.yml in Plugins/ScubaKit/  . It should look something like this;
	
scubaValues:
    leatherAir: 320
    diamondAir: 320
    ironAir: 320
    pumpkinAir: 2025
    chainAir: 320
    defaultAir: 320
    goldAir: 320
system:
    ignorePermissions: true
    SuperPerms: true
    blockHatInstalled: false

    
	I know the order is a little weird ...
	Anyway, the number listed is the number of tics you can stay underwater with that helm. 
	I believe vanilla Minecraft's default value is 300
	
	setting 'ignorePermissions' to false tells the addon to not bother checking for permissions, and just assume everyone
	is allowed to use scubagear.
	
	setting SuperPerms to true tells the plugin to use the bukkit API to do permissions checks (the new way) rather then hook into Permissions 2/3/4 directly.
	
4. Permissions and other plugin support?
	
	permission nodes (you should already know how to use these. If you don't, set ignorePermissions to true)
	
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.* - players can use all forms of scuba gear. 
    
    or you can get specific ...
    
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Pumpkin - players can use a pumpkin to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Diamond - players can use a diamond helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Iron - players can use a iron helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Gold - players can use a gold helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Chain - players can use a chain helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Leather - players can use a leather helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false

	There are also permission settings for other block types, for mods that allow you to put other stuff on your head. (BlockHat)
	
	ScubaKit.ScubaGear.<TypeID>
	
	where typeID is the block type. Example;
	
	ScubaKit.ScubaGear.20
	Would give a user to permission to have their air level changed by wearing a glass block.
	
	To change the air given by these blocks, you must set "blockHatInstalled" to true;
	
	blockHatInstalled: true
	
	this will tell the mod to expand your settings file to include settings for all block types.
