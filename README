1. What is ScubaKit?
	
	ScubaKit is a plugin for Bukkit (itself a mod for Minecraft) that allows helmets to be used as scuba diving dear.
	By default, only the pumpkin allows you to stay underwater for an extra chunk of time, but this can be configured.

2. How do I install ScubaKit?

	Simply place the ScubaKit.jar file into your Plugin directory. 
	If you got a jar file that reads something like ScubaKit-1.0.0.jar, you need to remove the "-1.0.0" part from it.
	I think, I never actually tested leaving it there. There is an included folder that contains the config.yml, but you don't HAVE to put that in. The plugin will create that automaticly

3. How do I configure ScubaKit?

	open config.yml in Plugins/ScubaKit/  . It should look something like this;
	
scubaValues:
    leatherAir: 320
    diamondAir: 320
    ironAir: 320
    pumpkinAir: 2025
    chainAir: 320
    defaultAir: 320
    goldAir: 320
system:
    ignorePermissions: true
    blockHatInstalled: false

    
	I know the order is a little weird ...
	Anyway, the number listed is the number of tics you can stay underwater with that helm. 
	I believe vanilla Minecraft's default value is 300
	
	setting 'ignorePermissions' to false tells the addon to not bother checking for permissions, and just assume everyone
	is allowed to use scubagear. 
	
4. Permissions and other plugin support?
	
	permission nodes (you should already know how to use these. If you don't, set ignorePermissions to true)
	
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.* - players can use all forms of scuba gear. 
    
    or you can get specific ...
    
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Pumpkin - players can use a pumpkin to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Diamond - players can use a diamond helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Iron - players can use a iron helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Gold - players can use a gold helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Chain - players can use a chain helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false
    ScubaKit.ScubaGear.Leather - players can use a leather helm to change their maximum air. This value is ignored if complexPermissions is false

  BlockHat. 
  This mod should work well with blockhat. Just set blockHatInstalled to true, and the plugin will add settings for other kinds of blocks.
