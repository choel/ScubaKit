1. What is ScubaKit?
	
	ScubaKit is a plugin for Bukkit (itself a mod for Minecraft) that allows helmets to be used as scuba diving dear.
	By default, only the pumpkin allows you to stay underwater for an extra chunk of time, but this can be configured.

2. How do I install ScubaKit?

	Simply place the ScubaKit.jar file into your Plugin directory. 
	If you got a jar file that reads something like ScubaKit-1.0.0.jar, you need to remove the "-1.0.0" part from it.
	I think, I never actually tested leaving it there. There is an included folder that contains the config.yml, but you don't HAVE to put that in. The plugin will create that automaticly

3. How do I configure ScubaKit?

	open config.yml in Plugins/ScubaKit/  . It should look something like this;
scubaValues:

    leatherAir: 320

    diamondAir: 320

    ironAir: 320

    pumpkinAir: 2025

    chainAir: 320

    defaultAir: 320

    goldAir: 320

	I know the order is a little weird ...
	Anyway, the number listed is the number of tics you can stay underwater with that helm. 
	I believe vanilla Minecraft's default value is 301

4. How do I contact the author
